Hey Erin, this is a blog post. You can write markdown and it will render as HTML.

For example:

## You're a huge fucking nerd

see? that was a heading. You can use `##` before a string of text to make it a heading. The number of `#` characters corresponds with the heading number in html. This means the above was an `<h2>`.

Love u
