A collaboration with [Void Femmes](https://voidfemmes.bandcamp.com)

## lyrics

In the dark I found a passage through
to navigate the stars in search of you
Hunting like a virus; astral flow
Drifting to the center's anti-glow

Won't be coming back from this one
Taken by its pull
If you're even there, what are you?
I need to know your form
