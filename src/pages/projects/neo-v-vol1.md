Quick note about downloading this mixtape: Because Bandcamp adds the mixtape name as well as the song name to the file you download, you may get an error when you try to unzip it about the file name being too long. To get around this, simply use a third-party unzipper like 7-zip or WinZip, as window's built-in extractor is lowkey garbage. Idk about macs. I'm sorry about this, but I refuse to change my artistic vision to capitulate to big tech

For the last year and a half I've been hard at work at my next full-length album, which I'm hoping to have out by the end of the year. When I got my surgery date I decided I wanted to release /something/ before I went under, and rather than rush to finish the album I decided to pull together a couple odds-and-ends and put out a series of more casual releases while my body heals.

These tracks come from a variety of fun sources. Near the end of last year I got really into Tracker software, specifically reNoise, as something to distract myself from the weeds of putting the finishing touches on my album. Tracks 1, 3, 4, and 6 were all originally sequenced in reNoise, with final mixing and embellishments done in Ableton.

Tracks 2 and 5 came out of a collection of old reels my family found in my Nana's shed after she died. These are tape reels from like, the 1960s that were used with a consumer reel-to-reel recorder. The tapes contained a mix of radio recordings from the era (this was in rural Manitoba so it's a lot of country recordings, and some comedy stuff as well) but also had some home recordings that my family had made on it. Sounds like recordings of family gatherings that would have happened in the mid 60s, and the little child's voice you hear singing on "Kitty Named Tiger" is in all likelihood my mother from when she was like, 6 years old or something? It's impossible to truly place the time or people in these recordings, but it's the best guess we could come up with. These tracks were originally going to go on my next album, but they didn't really fit the vibe or themes or narrative so I decided to take em off and give em a proper home here.

"Erin Fucking Corbette" is also pretty special as the sample in that song is a voice note sent to me by my dear friend and chess rival Jenna Geen aka Moonwatcher (moonwatch-er.bandcamp.com) out of the blue on Christmas Eve, about a real dream she apparently had that I was in.

I have a bunch more tracks curated to make up Vol 2 of this, and I'm hoping I'll have enough energy at /some/ point after my surgery to finish them up and put them out in a month or 2 or 3. If not, this will languish as "Vol 1 out of 1" for a good while. And that's ok.

Anyways thanks for listening, and keep an ear to the ground for updates on my upcoming full-length album which I think is going to be really good and special :)
