In a kingdom plagued by an unspeakable cosmic horror, Princess Sertralina leaves the keys to her palace with Mario while she goes on a quest to find the source of evil.

"Sertralina left her kingdom for me, said there's evil in the clouds and trees and ground and everywhere I look is one more reason to confront it, something's gotta give"
