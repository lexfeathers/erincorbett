A chopped-and-screwed album of wintry screeches, despondent pop, and glittery post-climate nightmare fantasies.

I wanted to capture the Nov-March sounds of:
- Cold endless winds
- The revving of a car stuck in a ditch
- Skidding out on a patch of ice
- Falling down
- Feeling FROSTY
- Feeling COZY
- A roaring fire
- Consumeristic Void
- Small bouts of wonder & beauty in an otherwise dark and depressing season
- Scraping ice off a window
- Frostbite
- Driving on a lake of frozen water
- becoming ice
- Etc

90% of this was recorded LIVE to a single stereo track with no overdubs, multitracking, or editing. I used an SP-404, electric guitar, and a small but versatile modular rack for all the sounds

The 10% that was overdubbed includes: the vocals on tracks 1 4 and 9, as well as most of track 9 which was composed in ableton
